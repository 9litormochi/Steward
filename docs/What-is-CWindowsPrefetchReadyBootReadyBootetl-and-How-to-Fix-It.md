# What is C:\Windows\Prefetch\ReadyBoot\ReadyBoot.etl and How to Fix It?
 
C:\Windows\Prefetch\ReadyBoot\ReadyBoot.etl is a file that is used by Windows to store data from previous boot sessions and optimize the boot time of your system. It is part of the ReadyBoot feature, which is a variant of the ReadyBoost technology that uses flash memory to speed up disk access. ReadyBoot works by preloading files into RAM before they are needed, based on a plan created from analyzing five previous boots. This way, it reduces the latency and improves the performance of your system during startup.

However, sometimes you may encounter an error message saying that "The maximum file size for session \"ReadyBoot\" has been reached. As a result, events might be lost (not logged) to file \"C:\\WINDOWS\\Prefetch\\ReadyBoot\\ReadyBoot.etl\". The maximum files size is currently set to 20971520 bytes."[^1^] This means that the ReadyBoot.etl file has reached its maximum size limit and cannot store any more data. This can happen if you have a large amount of RAM, a fast SSD, or frequent changes in your system configuration. The error does not affect the functionality of your system, but it may cause some events to be missed during boot optimization.
 
There are a few ways to fix this error and prevent it from happening again. One option is to increase the maximum file size limit for ReadyBoot.etl by editing the registry. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Press Windows + R, type "regedit" and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.
2. Navigate to the following key: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\ReadyBoot
3. Double-click on the value "MaxFileSize" and change its base to Decimal.
4. Enter a larger value in bytes, such as 40000000 (40 MB) or 80000000 (80 MB), depending on your RAM size and preference.
5. Click OK and close the Registry Editor.
6. Restart your system for the changes to take effect.

Another option is to disable ReadyBoot altogether if you have a fast SSD and enough RAM. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Press Windows + S, type "performance monitor" and open the application.
2. Expand "Data Collector Sets" and click on "Startup Event Trace Sessions".
3. Look for "ReadyBoot" using the navigation pane present at the right-side of the screen and double-click it.
4. Select the tab "Stop Condition" and uncheck the box "Enable".
5. Click OK and close the Performance Monitor.
6. Restart your system for the changes to take effect.

By following these methods, you can fix the error related to C:\Windows\Prefetch\ReadyBoot\ReadyBoot.etl and optimize your boot time according to your system specifications.
  
ReadyBoot is not the only feature that uses the Prefetch folder to store data for improving system performance. Another feature is Superfetch, which is a service that analyzes your usage patterns and preloads frequently used applications and files into RAM. This way, it reduces the load time and increases the responsiveness of your system. Superfetch also creates a file called Layout.ini in the Prefetch folder, which contains information about the optimal layout of files on your disk.
 
However, some users may experience problems with Superfetch, such as high disk usage, memory leaks, or compatibility issues with certain applications. In such cases, you may want to disable Superfetch and see if it improves your system performance. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Press Windows + R, type "services.msc" and press Enter to open the Services window.
2. Look for "Superfetch" in the list of services and double-click it.
3. Change the startup type to "Disabled" and click on "Stop" to stop the service.
4. Click OK and close the Services window.
5. Restart your system for the changes to take effect.

Alternatively, you can disable Superfetch using the Registry Editor. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Press Windows + R, type "regedit" and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.
2. Navigate to the following key: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\PrefetchParameters
3. Double-click on the value "EnableSuperfetch" and change its data to 0.
4. Click OK and close the Registry Editor.
5. Restart your system for the changes to take effect.

By disabling Superfetch, you may free up some RAM and disk space, but you may also lose some benefits of faster application loading and system responsiveness. You can experiment with different settings and see what works best for your system.
